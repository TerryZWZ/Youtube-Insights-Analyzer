Using the transcript provided below, create an insight-dense summary and an incremental value analysis which should describe what extra value the full video provides beyond the summary.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Formatting:
    Use # to indicate a title.
    Use ## between text to indicate headings.
    Use • to indicate points.
    Use this exact section order:
        # <title>
        ## 🧠 <Summary Topic> (repeat as needed; you can have consecutive summary topics)
        ## 🔍 Incremental Value (Full Video)

2. Emoji Use:
    Begin each heading with an emoji that best represents the content or theme of that point.

3. Content:
    Summary section:
        Capture the key points and overall message with concrete specifics (methods, claims, steps, numbers) when present.
        Avoid LLM-ish contrasts like “it’s not X, it’s Y”.
    Incremental value section:
        Explain what additional, specific information a viewer would gain by watching the full video that the summary cannot fully cover.
        Include items like: detailed walkthrough steps, examples/case studies, edge cases/troubleshooting, nuance/rationale, and any visuals/demos explicitly referenced in the transcript.
        Do not speculate about visuals; only mention visuals/demos if the transcript indicates them.

Example:
    # Name of Title
    ## 🍎 Topic A
    • Point
    • Point
    ## 🍏 Topic B
    • Point
    • Point
    ## 🔍 Incremental Value (Full Video)
    • Visuals/demos you would see (if mentioned)
    • Extra details beyond summary

Video Metadata:
Title: {title}
Channel: {channel}
Duration (seconds): {duration_seconds}

Remember to format correctly and return only the formatted output (no extra commentary).
